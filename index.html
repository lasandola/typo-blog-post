                <p>Dreams are defined as the succession of hallucinatory images, scenarios, ideas, emotions, and
                    sensations
                    that occur involuntarily within the mind during certain stages of sleep. Although the content and
                    purpose of dreams are not well understood they have been a topic of scientific research, as well as
                    philosophical and religious interest throughout many aspects of recorded history.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
        <div class="txt">
            <p>There is solid scientific evidence which clearly indicates that dreams are a common occurrence throughout
                the
                lives of most human beings and other mammals in general. Although there may be many psychoactive
                substances
                which are capable of inducing realistic hallucinations, it is worth noting that these compounds simply
                induce a state of mind during waking consciousness which the brain is already adept at generating during
                normal sleep.
                Dreams may be broken down into five differing levels of clarity and intensity described below:</p>

            <h3>Imaginative visualization</h3>
            <p>At the lowest level, a person may experience a heightened state of mental
                visualization that one drifts into when daydreaming or using their imagination. This state results in a
                level of visualization that is mostly felt internally within the mind's eye instead of being visually
                perceived. It can be described as a short-term detachment from a person's immediate surroundings, during
                which a person's contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by a fantasy. The generation
                of the details of this internal visualization are partially autonomous in nature, but mostly controlled
                by the content of one's current thought stream. This level is extremely common and occurs frequently
                during waking consciousness on a daily basis.</p>
            <h3>Partially defined hypnagogia</h3>
            <p>At this level, the experience of daydreaming and general imagination
                begins to progressively heighten and form into what is known as «hypnagogia». This is defined as the
                experience of the transitional state between wakefulness to sleep and generally consists of hearing
                indistinct noises and seeing faded imagery behind closed eyelids. This level is commonly experienced as
                a person begins to fall asleep.</p>
            <h3>Fully defined hypnagogia</h3>
            <p>At this level, the vividness and intensity slightly increases and spontaneous
                imagery becomes fully defined in its appearance and is now seen within a person's direct line of sight
                under closed eyelids. Alongside this, audible noises, such as fleeting voices, music, and general
                auditory hallucinations are often present.</p>
            <h3>Partially defined dreams</h3>
            <p>At this level, the ability to hallucinate increases, with random flashes of
                spontaneous hallucinatory scenarios beginning to show themselves. The hallucinations longer consist of
                fleeting imagery on the back of a person's closed eyelids, but become sustained as all-encompassing
                settings which surround the dreamer in what feels like a breakthrough into an alternate reality. In
                terms of sensory vividness, the dreams are not completely defined in their appearance or sound. This
                means that they often display themselves as partially to completely blurred and transparent.
                Additionally, the dreamer's physical body will often still feel at least partially connected to the real
                world. Other senses, such as touch, taste, and smell, may be extremely vague or entirely absent.</p>

            <h3>Fully defined dreams</h3>
            <p>At the highest level, all five senses are replicated perfectly as the dream
                becomes completely realistic and indistinguishable from that of everyday reality in terms of the detail
                and sensory vividness that they provide. These sensations are equally capable of including both positive
                sensations, such as sexual orgasm, and negative sensations, such as pain and physical bodily harm.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Subjective effects</h2>

            <h3>Internally sourced sensory input</h3>

            <p>The most fundamental component of any dream or hallucinatory state can be defined as some form of
                perceivable
                sensory input. This differs from that of everyday sensory input in that it is received from an internal
                source created by a person's own mind as opposed to an external source within their perceivable
                surrounding
                environment. A dreamscape, the internal environment in which a dream takes place, is capable of
                manifesting
                itself completely realistically, with convincing and detailed equivalents of any or all of the five
                senses
                across varying degrees of vividness and intensity.</p>

            <h3>Externally sourced sensory input</h3>

            <p>The majority of the perceived input in a dream is created within a person's mind, however, some senses
                such
                as hearing always allow external input. In a dream, an externally sourced sound event may not be
                consciously
                perceived as directly as in waking life. However, parts of the sound may manifest itself in the dream as
                either the original sound or a distorted version of it. For example, an airplane in the physical world
                may
                be perceived as a thunderstorm in the dream. This is, however, not limited to only hearing, as other
                senses,
                such as touch and smell, are also possible, and both the input and its manifestation within the dream
                may be
                multisensory.</p>

            <h3>Perspective</h3>

            <p>Concerning the perspective in which dreams are perceived through, just like literary plots, dreams can be
                experienced through four alternative vantage points which are described and listed below. The
                perspective
                through which dreams are perceived through may be experienced through the four alternative vantage
                points
                described below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1st person – The most common dream perspective, which can be described as the standard experience of
                    perceiving the scenario from the perspective of a person's everyday self and body.</li>
                <li>2nd person – This perspective can be described as the experience of seeing the dream from the
                    viewpoint
                    of an external source of consciousness, such as another person, an animal, or an inanimate object.
                </li>
                <li>3rd person – This perspective is similar to an out-of-body experience and can be described as
                    perceiving
                    a dream from a perspective which is floating above, below, behind, or in front of the dreamer's
                    physical
                    body. It is worth noting that for unknown reasons many people consistently and exclusively dream in
                    the
                    third person perspective.
                </li>
                <li>4th person – This perspective can be described as the experience of perceiving the dream from the
                    viewpoint of multiple vantage points simultaneously.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Setting</h3>

            <p>At levels 4 and 5 dreams consistently manifest themselves through extremely detailed imaginary
                landscapes,
                locations, and sceneries of infinite variety. These exist to act as the setting in which the plot of the
                dream occurs. The geography of these settings is capable of rendering itself as static and coherent in
                organization, but will usually result in a non-linear, nonsensical, and continuously changing layout
                which
                does not obey the laws of physics. The appearance and style of these settings appear to be selected at
                random, and are often entirely novel.

                    within a person's memories, especially those which are prominent in their daily life.»

            Within the dreamscape, relevant and irrelevant objects may either be placed in appropriate or inappropriate
            locations and may be interacted with in the same way that any real life object can be, and may react in
            unexpected and spontaneous ways. However, these objects typically behave as the dreamer expects them to.</p>

            <h3>Dream characters</h3>

            <p>Across the setting of almost any dream, the scenery is inhabited and populated by conscious dream
                characters
                who can be spoken to and communicated with in extreme amounts of detail. These entities appear to be the
                inhabitants of a perceived independent reality – they are expectant of one's appearance and interact
                with
                the dreamer in various ways.
                In terms of their appearance, dream characters can show themselves as literally anything but will
                usually
                display themselves as perfectly ordinary people. These people are equally likely to be complete
                strangers or
                randomly selected people which the dreamer has encountered throughout their life. The more prominent and
                emotionally significant the person is, the more likely they are to be encountered within the dreamscape.
                There are distinctly different types of dream characters which one may encounter, each of which
                represents a
                particular subsection of one's consciousness through both their visible form and their personality.
                These
                can be broken down into three separate categories and include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Representations of the self – The simplest form of dream character can be described as simply a
                    mirror
                    of one's personality. It can take any visible form but clearly adopts an obviously identical
                    vocabulary
                    and set of mannerisms to one's personality when conversed with.</li>
                <li>Representations of specific concepts or people – This category of dream character is by far the most
                    varied type in terms of its visual form and immediately perceivable personality. It can be
                    identified as
                    a simulated representation of any internally stored concept and adopts an appropriate personality to
                    fit
                    this to an unusual degree of accurate detail. For example this particular concept could include
                    people
                    one has met throughout their life, fictional characters or symbolic representations of abstract
                    concepts
                    such as emotions or essential parts of one's personality.</li>
                <li>Representations of the subconscious – This category of dream character can take any visible form but
                    adopts the personality of what seems to be a conscious controller behind the continuous generation
                    of
                    the details behind one's own dreamscape and internally stored model of reality. When conversed with
                    it
                    usually adopts an attitude which wants to teach or guide the dreamer and assumes that it knows what
                    is
                    best for them.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When communicated with through spoken word the level of coherency in which these entities can reply with
                is
                highly variable but can be broken down into 4 distinct levels of communication:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Silence – this level can be defined as a complete unresponsiveness from the side of the dream
                    character
                    and an incapability of speech despite their prominent presence within the dream.</li>
                <li>Partially defined incoherent speech – this level can be defined as audible linguistic conversational
                    responses and noises which sound like words but do not contain any real content or meaning beyond a
                    vague sense of emotional intent.</li>
                <li>Fully defined incoherent speech – this level can be defined as audible linguistic conversational
                    responses and noises which contain fully defined and understandable words but often lack grammatical
                    structure or general coherency.</li>
                <li>Partially defined coherent speech – this level can be defined as audible linguistic conversational
                    responses and noises which contain fully defined and understandable words with a partially defined
                    grammatical structure and general coherency which conveys its point on a level which may not always
                    be
                    entirely understandable but is still capable of expressing a general point.</li>
                <li>Fully defined coherent speech – this level can be defined as audible linguistic conversational
                    responses
                    and noises which contain fully defined and understandable words as well as fully defined grammatical
                    structure and general coherency which conveys its point on a level which is on par with the
                    dreamer's
                    own intellect.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scenarios and plots</h3>

            <p>Each dream component is randomly shuffled and compiled into an infinite variety of potential plots and
                scenarios. These may be positive or negative to experience and are challenging to define in a
                comprehensive
                manner in much the same way that we cannot predict the plot of abstract literature or films. They can,
                however, be broken down into basic occurrences which entail visiting any number of settings which
                contain
                within them any number of interactive dream characters. Additionally, completely unpredictable plot
                devices,
                events, and occurrences force the dreamer to become involved within within the specific scenario of the
                dream.
                These scenarios and plots can be linear and logical, with events that occur in a logical sequence which
                lead
                into each other through cause and effect. Equally likely, however, are scenarios and plots that present
                themselves as nonsensical and incoherent. This means that the plot will occur with natural events which
                are
                capable of switching between each other repeatedly in rapid succession. The plots themselves can either
                be
                entirely new experiences that are unlike anything experienced within the real world, old experiences,
                such
                as memory replays, or a combination of the two. It is possible in some cases for the plot of the dream
                to be
                changed by the thoughts of the dreamer, for example the dreamer could think of a person and the person
                appear around the corner. However this is anecdotal and not common.
                The perception of time in hallucinatory dream scenarios typically feel as if they are being experienced
                in
                real-time, which means that if 20 seconds are perceived to have passed within the dream the same amount
                of
                time will have elapsed in the real world. However, it is also possible for time distortions to occur,
                resulting in scenarios and plots that can feel as if they last days, weeks, or even an infinite amount
                of
                time.
                A standard component of any dream is a strong sense of uncontrollable and powerful plot acceptance. This
                feeling allows the dreamer to accept any plot within a dream as an entirely real event in which the
                results
                of a person's own actions have genuine consequences regarding the dreamer's life. This acceptance
                motivates
                the dreamer to avoid danger, solve puzzles, and accept the scenarios and plots as reality even if it is
                clearly and undeniably more likely to be a dream than an event which could ever occur within real life.

            <h2>Hypotheses for the mechanics of dreams</h2>

            <p>While the exact mechanics of dreams remain unknown and the tulpa phenomenon remains unproven
                scientifically,
                the tulpa community has given rise to several popular speculative hypotheses that try to explain the
                mechanics that would allow people to experience the phenomenon, one of which is proposed below.</p>

            <h3>Simulatory mind hypothesis</h3>

            <p>The simulatory mind hypothesis posits that basic thought, imagination, dreaming, and hallucination are
                all
                essentially the result of the same mechanism rendering data at different levels of detail within a
                neurological simulation framework system which exists to mirror the external environment by categorizing
                the
                sensory input it receives into a database of separate concepts and subconcepts in order to later use
                these
                for the processing of ideas and thoughts.
                Assuming this is true, a person's mind's eye could be thought of as similar to a computer simulation
                framework which uses its internally stored memories to render concepts and ideas at varying levels of
                detail. Although the detail at which this renders concepts during everyday life is usually low, during
                dreams and hallucinations this system is capable of generating data that is detailed enough to be
                hyper-realistic and indistinguishable from waking life. This includes the ability to generate autonomous
                entities which are capable of coherent conversation.
                This suggests that dreams are merely a neurological computer simulation framework which becomes
                activated
                during sleep, which has a database comprised of internally stored concepts which one has encountered
                throughout their life. This randomizes, shuffles, and splices its particular set of memories, concepts,
                and
                variable together in a manner which places emphasis upon concepts with recency and person emotional
                significance.
                The question as to why such a system would exist within the brain at all is an interesting one. It
                perhaps
                exists for the straightforward and basic purpose of generating potential scenarios which one may
                encounter
                in life as a means of internal practice to encourage survival should the possible event occur in real
                life.
                This would explain why dreams play such a huge emphasis on one's own fears and desires and indicates
                that
                they, therefore, serve a fundamentally important evolutionary function.</p>
